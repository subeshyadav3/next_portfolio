It was first published in the anthology The Happy Prince and Other Tales in 1888.

He had a beautiful garden in his castle. There were beautiful flowering plants, soft grass and twelve peach trees in his garden. In sprinig seasons, peach trees used to bear beautiful pink and pearl flowers and in autumn, they used to bear rich fruits. The birds used to sit in the trees and sing-song very sweetly.</b></span></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #656565; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 0px 0px; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border: 0px; font-family: arial; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><b style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">Every afternoon, many children used to play in that Giant's garden when they came back from school.</b></span></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #656565; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 0px 0px; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border: 0px; font-family: arial; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><b style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">Seven years ago, the Giant had gone to visit his friend named Cornish Ogre. One day, he came back to his castle. He found children playing in his garden. He became quite furious to see that sight. He cried, "What are you doing there?" The children ran away out of fear. The children became quite sad because they didn't have a proper place to play. They didn't like to play on the road due to its dust and hard stones. The Giant built a high wall around his garden and put up a notice-board on which he wrote a warning line:</b></span></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #656565; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 0px 0px; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border: 0px; color: #660000; font-family: arial; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><b style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">"TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED"</b></span></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #656565; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 0px 0px; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border: 0px; font-family: arial; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><b style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">When the season of spring came, there were little blossoms and birds all over the country. But the garden of the selfish Giant became completely desolate. Snow, frost, the north wind and hail came there one by one. The Giant became quite sad because everywhere summer, spring and autumn came but in his garden, there was always winter. One morning, the Giant heard very lovely and sweet music. It was a little linnet singing outside his window. A delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. He thought that the spring had come. He peeped out but saw a wonderful sight. The children had come into the garden through a little hole in the wall. They were sitting in every branch of the trees. The trees were in full bloom. The birds were twittering and singing melodiously. In the farthest corner of the garden, there was standing a very little boy who couldn't reach the branches. Seeing that sight, the Giant's heart melted. He said to himself, "How selfish I have been! Now I have understood why spring didn't come in my garden". The Giant took the little boy and seated him into the tree. The little boy kissed the Giant feeling happy. The Giant said to the children, "It is your garden now, little children!" Thus, there was again spring throughout the year.</b></span></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #656565; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 0px 0px; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border: 0px; font-family: arial; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><b style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">After many years, the Giant became quite old and weak. He kept on watching the children at their games. He didn't meet the lovable little boy after his first meeting. He inquired about him a lot but couldn't get any information about him.</b></span></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #656565; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 0px 0px; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border: 0px; font-family: arial; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><b style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">One morning, during wintertime, he saw a marvellous sight of a tree in the farthest corner of the garden. He saw white flowers, golden branches and silver fruits of the tree. He saw the same little boy underneath the tree. He became quite happy and rushed towards him. He became angry to see prints of nails on little boy's palms and feet. Eventually, he realised that the little boy was a divine power of God. Once, the Giant had let the little boy play in his garden. The little boy also wanted to take the Giant to his garden of Paradise in return. The Giant died at last and his dead body was completely covered with white flowers.</b></span></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #656565; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 0px 0px; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border: 0px; font-family: arial; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><b style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">This story teaches us not to be selfish.

The boy kissed the giant being happy. The giant broke the wall of his garden and allowed all the children to play in his garden. He started playing with them. Time passed by, the giant became old and feeble. He tried his best to find his lovable boy most of the time but couldn't find him. One day, while he was sitting on his chair, he saw the same boy once again in one of the corners of the garden. He rushed towards there but became angry to find signs of nails on the boy's palms and feet.

The Chateau which we find here in this story is completely deserted and very old fashioned. The setting inside and outside seem very terrible. The apartments inside Chateau are so unmanaged and dirty. The apartment where the narrator and his valet stay have many things for decoration but all of them are in decaying state. The life-like portrait has been placed in one of the dark corners. The surrounding of the life-like portrait is so disturbing due to the unmanaged condition everywhere. The arrival of the visitors also has added distance in the environment. The portrait seems quite valueless in that desolate environment of the Chateau.</span></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #6d7680; font-family: Merriweather; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span face="Poppins, sans-serif" style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; color: #333333; font-size: medium; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7074038989098423" data-ad-format="auto" data-ad-slot="1724855762" data-full-width-responsive="true" style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; display: block; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-decoration-line: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></ins></span></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #6d7680; font-family: Merriweather; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><b style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; font-size: medium; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">c.

He had two shops and a house. He was a handsome man with fair-curly hair. He was full of fun and very fond of singing. He used to drink much before marriage but later on, he changed himself and became a good man. He had virtuous qualities such as faith, forgiveness, freedom and acceptance. He was accused of murdering a fellow merchant and robbing him. He suffered a lot in prison and spent his twenty-six years waiting for God's judgement.

He has spent his whole life in Siberian prison expecting for the right judgement of God. After being suspected by his wife, he gives up all his hopes and tells himself that God only knows the truth. For twenty-six years as a convict in Siberia, he grows older. In prison, Aksionov works hard and learns to make boots. He earns a little money with which he buys the book 'The Lives of the Saints'. He devotes his life in the name of religion being much faithful on God. He starts reading and singing this book in the prison's church on Sundays. He realizes about various aspects of life, fate in connection with the religion. The prison authorities even like him for his meekness. His fellow-prisoners respect him and call him "Grandfather" or "The Saint." He knows about fate, spirituality, God's devotion, righteous path, acceptance, forgiveness etc. He keeps on showing his truthfulness. He meets the real murderer of the merchant but remains silent. He even saves the convict from the governor. He gets self-realization and forgives Makar at the end. Aksionov realizes that forgiveness is the path to peace. He obtains peace at last and dies. In this way, we find him and his life-transforming from materialism to spiritualism only because of religion.</span></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #6d7680; font-family: Merriweather; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: medium; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7074038989098423" data-ad-format="auto" data-ad-slot="1724855762" data-full-width-responsive="true" style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; display: block; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-decoration-line: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></ins></span></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #6d7680; font-family: Merriweather; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: medium; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><b style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">b.

We can take this story as a motivational story too because the child completed his journey or challenges as birthday gift encouraged him. The child seems fearful while watching his scab. He thinks much about picking it. He raises many questions with himself. He picks out his scab being panic. But when he sees the carpet his fear increases high. He imaginatively makes a game plan. He gathers his confidence to cross the carpet. He creates his obstacles supposing the colours as coals and snakes. He even puts his goal across the carpet. He moves on bravely on the carpet wishing for a puppy on his birthday as a birthday gift. He tries his best to overcome his fear. His self-confidence and his wish end as he falls down in black colours.</span></span></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #6d7680; font-family: Merriweather; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><b style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7074038989098423" data-ad-format="auto" data-ad-slot="1724855762" data-full-width-responsive="true" style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; display: block; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-decoration-line: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></ins></b></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #6d7680; font-family: Merriweather; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><b style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><i style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background: 0px 0px black; border: 0px; color: white; font-size: large; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"> Reference beyond the text </span></i></b></p><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #6d7680; font-family: Merriweather; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><b style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background: 0px 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: medium; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">a.

He uses this line when he gets his bicycle back in a fine condition out of the ground.
